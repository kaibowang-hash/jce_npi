# V1.2 Autopilot Controller

Updated: `2026-07-31T07:00:05Z`

## Authority and operating mode

The repository is in V1.2 continuous-delivery mode on
`codex/npi-v1.2-implementation`. After a Phase Gate is `PASS`, execution moves
to the next phase without waiting for another prompt. Product, domain,
architecture, industrial-UX, localization, security, ownership and release
rules remain mandatory. Production ERPNext must not be contacted.

The execution authority order is the latest compatible user instruction,
`AGENTS.md`, the authoritative V1.2 DOCX together with the accepted additive
reconciliation, the V1.2 Execution Pack, contracts/accepted ADRs, applicable
Skills, and reversible implementation choices. The current DOCX/Pack
crosswalk is machine-readable in
`implementation/V1_2_DOCX_PACK_COVERAGE_MATRIX.csv`; historical differences
remain in `DOCX_PACK_DEVIATIONS.md`. A material conflict pauses only affected
work unless it blocks everything.

The Execution Pack means the repository's actual `GOAL.md`, contracts, docs,
design rules, specifications, implementation records, prompts, localization
material, and Skills; this controller coordinates that Pack and never replaces
it with a second product specification. The 2026-07-25 reconciliation addendum
and the append-only 2026-07-27 `FR-UX-043` correction amend the Pack
additively: all 229 DOCX IDs, 39 Pack-only normalized IDs and 14 clarification
IDs remain visible in the current 282-row trace. The historical 281-row R1-01
checkpoint remains unchanged. Only reversible implementation details may be
selected without a business decision. A material conflict is recorded as a
Decision Request and never resolved by silently overwriting an authority.

## Permanent product and ownership boundaries

- NPI One is an independent engineering-project, NPI, and Tooling collaboration
  platform with its own Frappe Site/database and a React + TypeScript normal-user
  SPA. Desk remains an administration, audit, configuration, and support tool.
- The SPA follows the approved Siemens iX Classic Light / classic industrial
  engineering direction through company-owned tokens: one restrained dark-teal
  primary, predominantly neutral colors, square 0–2 px geometry, flat borders,
  dense trees/tables/split workspaces, stable toolbars and inspectors. Colorful
  card walls, gradients, glass effects, strong shadows, decorative consumer
  dashboards, and Siemens restricted brand assets are prohibited.
- English is the only source-copy language. All normal-user copy uses the local
  Frappe-compatible translation adapter/catalog and has complete direct `zh`
  and `zh-TW` coverage. Except for approved terminology, abbreviations, codes,
  units, formal names, filenames, and business data, mixed-language UI is a
  release blocker.
- Tooling Requirement, Tooling Master, Tooling Revision, Tooling Set, Insert,
  Cavity, and Trial are separate domain concepts. They must not be collapsed
  into a convenience record or lifecycle; Trial rounds bind exact Tooling,
  product, material, parameter, sample, cavity, defect, and evidence versions.
- NPI One owns development process, engineering baselines, stage gates,
  Tooling development, Trial collaboration, NPI readiness, and major
  engineering change. ERPNext owns formal customer/supplier/item master data,
  MBOM, purchasing, inventory, production, finance/cost, formal quality,
  production Tooling assets/maintenance, and production execution. A shared
  field has exactly one declared master; no direct database write or dual
  master is permitted.

## ERPNext reconciliation gate

Before implementing formal behavior that overlaps an existing ERPNext
customization, inspect the supplied custom apps, DocTypes/fields, workflows,
scripts, hooks/APIs, reports/prints, roles/permissions, numbering, lifecycle,
Tooling/quality/change/file customizations, and sanitized runtime evidence.
When complete, record the overlap/conflict matrix, object and field ownership,
numbering and lifecycle authority, reuse/extend/replace/interface decisions,
migration impact, and interface mapping. When incomplete, use the single
`REQUIRED_INPUTS.md`, pause only fact-dependent production mapping, and continue
contracts, explicit mocks, tests, documentation, and sandbox-ready adapters.

NPI One and ERPNext are not currently interconnected. Production ERPNext must
not be contacted, and no readiness work may be represented as a successful ERP
execution. Until reconciliation facts and separate activation approval exist,
the NPI One side is limited to Integration Readiness, explicit Mock behavior,
contracts, fault/retry evidence, and Sandbox-ready preparation.

## Continuous loop

Derive the next task by scanning `PHASE_STATUS.yaml` in phase order for the
first status other than `PASS`. A non-`PASS` phase remains the first incomplete
phase even when its Gate explicitly permits independent later work. Later-phase
work may start only when that phase's committed Gate names an exact
trace/addendum-approved continuation state and explicitly authorizes the
transition; the pending item must remain visible and must not be relabelled
`PASS`. Without that evidence, the next task stays in the first incomplete
phase.

For the first safely executable atomic task under that rule: use committed
requirement anchors and traceability as the index, read its related Pack
requirements and applicable skills, map requirements to implementation and
tests, implement one complete vertical slice, run the validation level defined
below, review the diff and traceability, repair failures up to five genuine
rounds, update evidence and controller state, commit the applicable checkpoint,
push this non-main branch and continue. A gate must never pass through skipped
checks, weakened criteria, fake data or fake success.

Every Phase loop covers static/type/lint checks; unit, API, integration and
permission tests; frontend/component/E2E tests; localization and mixed-language
scans; token, accessibility and visual regression review; security,
migration/rollback, health and recovery checks; Git diff review; requirement
traceability; evidence/status/risk/decision/blocker updates; and the complete
Quality Gate. Failures receive up to five genuine repair rounds. Tests,
thresholds, requirements, and evidence must never be deleted, skipped, weakened,
hard-coded, or falsified to manufacture PASS. A checkpoint is pushed before
automatic transition to the next Phase.

## Context and validation levels

Validation is cumulative across delivery boundaries: narrower checks optimize
the repair loop but never remove tests, reduce coverage, lower PASS criteria,
or replace a later Phase/PR/release gate.

### Level 1 — Incremental Check

Use for one small fix, local refactor, or test correction inside an active
atomic task. Derive and record a `changed-files → affected-tests` mapping, then
run only changed-file formatting/lint/type checks, directly related
unit/component tests, affected page/language/visual cases, necessary targeted
security or permission tests, and `git diff --check`. Shared components or
catalog edits require the affected page matrix, not automatically the complete
visual matrix.

### Level 2 — Task Gate

Use when an atomic task is complete. Run the current module's complete tests;
all affected API, permission, integration, E2E, i18n, and visual checks; current
Requirement ID traceability; the complete Task Diff Review; and every current
task acceptance criterion. Preserve exact commands and results as task
evidence. Level 2 does not declare a Phase or release complete.

### Level 3 — Full Release Gate

Use only at Phase completion, PR merge readiness, production release, changes
to public architecture/contracts/Schema/authentication/permission models,
changes to the shared design system/translation framework/core infrastructure,
or changes with multi-domain impact that cannot be bounded reliably. Run the
whole-repository type/lint/test suite; all API, permission, integration and E2E
checks; the complete English/`zh`/`zh-TW` matrix; the complete visual regression
matrix; security, migration, rollback, recovery; complete requirement
traceability; and the `release-gate` Skill. Save complete reproducible evidence.
If impact analysis is unreliable, escalate to Level 3 rather than guessing.

Failures sharing one root cause may be repaired together in one repair round.
After a related batch, rerun affected checks first; do not restart a complete
Gate after every individual failure. Run the applicable Task, Phase, PR, or
release Gate only after the batch is green. An Incremental Check can never be
used to bypass the complete Phase-level Gate.

Repair-round accounting is product-root based:

- Runner tools, package presentation, container/Bench/Site bootstrap, App
  registry, migration invocation, verifier metadata, and clearly synthetic
  fixture-precondition failures are environment remediation. They remain
  fail-closed and require fresh evidence, but do not consume a product-root
  repair round.
- A behavior-neutral diagnostic checkpoint that emits only closed stage codes,
  validated exception types and exact trace IDs is
  `IN_PROGRESS_DIAGNOSTIC`. It does not consume a product-root repair round and
  is never a Gate `PASS`.
- A product-root repair round begins only after the pinned environment,
  guarded disposable Site, required App installations and migrations, and
  current-task fixture preconditions have passed and evidence uniquely proves
  one implementation root inside the active task.
- A disproved and fully forward-reverted candidate is retained as evidence but
  is not represented as a completed product-root repair. A proven repair that
  advances the same unchanged Gate to a new downstream root counts once.

Under standing automatic-delivery authority, safe diagnostic narrowing and a
uniquely proven in-scope repair continue inside the active task and remaining
product-root budget. Exhausting a per-dispatch diagnostic allowance is an
execution-authority hold only when the governing user instruction explicitly
made that allowance terminal; it is not by itself a product Hard Blocker.
Requirement, API, permission, Schema, ownership, lock, version, audit,
idempotency, transaction-order and PASS-criterion changes remain outside this
automatic repair authority.

Only a Hard Blocker defined by the governing instruction may stop the whole
loop. Missing production ERPNext material does not block contracts, mock and
sandbox-ready adapters, tests, UI or documentation. Missing reconciliation
facts pause only formal logic that depends on those facts.

The exhaustive Hard Blockers are: a required one-time Codespace create/rebuild
click; required GitHub browser authorization; required production secret or
production-system permission; irreversible production-data action; mutually
unsatisfiable highest-priority Pack rules; a required change to approved
architecture, industrial UI, language strategy, or data ownership; missing core
business facts on which *all* remaining work depends; a necessary Gate still
failing after five complete product-root repair rounds; or a concrete
license/security risk. An environment remediation or
`IN_PROGRESS_DIAGNOSTIC` state cannot be relabelled as `PASS`, but neither is a
Hard Blocker while a safe in-scope action remains under current authority.
Stopping records one cause, completed scope, and the single user action needed.

Final completion requires a reproducible build and deployment, type and lint
checks, unit/API/permission/integration/E2E/visual tests, complete trilingual
coverage with zero unapproved mixing, security and migration/rollback checks,
health/backup/restore instructions, requirement-to-code/test evidence, no
accepted-path TODO/stub/placeholder/fake data, no unrecorded deviation, UAT
paths and truthful unsigned UAT status, and a passing release gate. The only
terminal controller states are `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE` or `BLOCKED_EXTERNAL`.

## Durable recovery protocol

1. On a new session or Phase switch, read `AGENTS.md`, `GOAL.md`,
   `PHASE_STATUS.yaml`, `QUALITY_GATE.md`, the
   traceability/blocker/decision/risk/deviation logs, the current phase gate and
   phase specification, `NEXT_ACTION.md`, `LAST_RUN.md`, accepted ADRs and
   applicable skills.
2. Confirm the branch is `codex/npi-v1.2-implementation`; do not develop on
   `main`. Inspect Git status and preserve unrelated user changes.
3. Resume the first incomplete atomic task recorded in `NEXT_ACTION.md`; do not
   repeat work already evidenced by a passing checkpoint.
4. Before interruption, update status, next action, last run, traceability and
   evidence, then commit and push a complete recoverable checkpoint when the
   environment permits it.

At the start of an atomic task, read only its task record, indexed requirement
anchor/traceability rows, related domain specifications, contracts/ADRs, and
applicable Skills. Within that task, use the committed context and evidence;
do not repeatedly reread the full DOCX, `GOAL.md`, all Pack files, or unrelated
domains for small fixes. Expand reading only for a material ambiguity, contract
conflict, cross-domain impact, or insufficient anchor. The checked-in 229-row
DOCX extraction and coverage matrix are the normal requirement index; do not
re-read or re-extract the complete DOCX in every repair loop.

If context or execution may end, perform step 4 before any further feature
work. On resumption, trust committed evidence, start from the recorded first
incomplete atomic task, and never repeat already passing implementation.

Cloud-host checks and Codespaces checks are separate evidence lanes. Missing
Docker, denied registry access, or another Cloud-host limitation never revokes,
overwrites, or re-runs a valid committed Codespaces Gate. A task whose
acceptance requires Docker, a rebuilt Codespace, or local Frappe runtime is
recorded as environment-specific external validation; Cloud may continue only
documentation, static analysis, or other work whose acceptance it can execute
and report honestly. A toolchain change that requires fresh-target proof stays
pending until that proof is produced in Codespaces.

## Current checkpoint

- Active execution goal: `implementation/ACTIVE_EXECUTION_GOAL.md`.
- Branch: `codex/npi-v1.2-implementation`.
- Phase 5 remains `IN_PROGRESS`; P5-00, P5-01 and P5-02 are `PASS`.
- P5-02 product checkpoint
  `f088d70b00b54488587b2a83a311b636ef48cf78` passed complete normal CI
  `30661086073`, final unchanged controlled-Site workflow `30661586342` and
  its Level 2 Task Gate. Complete evidence:
  `implementation/evidence/phase-5/p5-02-validation.md`.
- P5-03 is the only active atomic task. Its bounded Requirement/domain audit
  passed, and the domain/metadata foundation is active in
  `implementation/NEXT_ACTION.md`.
- P5-04, P5-05 and Phase 6 remain inactive.
- No active Hard Blocker or execution hold exists. Production numbering,
  reviewer/approver authority, signatures, baseline/invalidation authority,
  production dependency matrix, external identity/retrieval, scanner/viewer
  providers, CAD/PDM and production ERPNext remain scoped fail-closed holds
  and are not represented as implemented.
- Current trace remains 282 unique IDs:
  `173 PACK_CANONICAL / 95 DOCX_RECONCILED / 14 ADDENDUM_DIRECT`.
- Existing uncommitted workspace changes remain user-owned and must not be
  staged with an Auto Pilot checkpoint.

## Historical checkpoint through P5-01 recovery

- Active execution goal: `implementation/ACTIVE_EXECUTION_GOAL.md`.
- Current synchronized recovery checkpoint:
  `ee8730133e8cdd30fc7bff158ab80a252ed14249`.
- Completed bridge tasks: `R1-01 — DOCX Pack reconciliation addendum and
  machine trace`, `R1-02 — LaunchFlow display brand adapter and exact supplied
  assets` (`PASS — LEVEL 2`), `R1-03 — App Shell collapsed navigation command
  and contextual quick-create`
  (`PASS — LEVEL 3 PUBLIC SESSION-CONTRACT TASK GATE`), and
  `R1-04 — Shared grid sizing personalization views and export foundation`
  (`PASS — LEVEL 3 GRID PERSONALIZATION/SCHEMA TASK GATE`), and
  `R1-05 — Resizable panes, field attachment, and icon action primitives`
  (`PASS — STAGES 1–3`), and
  `R1-06 — Controlled undo prototype gate and 1440 visual governance`
  (`PASS — LEVEL 2 TASK GATE; STAGE 2 PRODUCT APPROVAL HOLD RETAINED`).
  R1 is an inserted bridge, not a replacement controller Phase.
- Current controller task:
  `P5-01 — Document and design revision`
  (`IN_PROGRESS — RESUME AUDIT PASS; FRONTEND/RUNTIME READY`).
- The R1 bridge and its cumulative shared Shell/design/i18n Level 3 exit Gate
  are `PASS`. The bounded P5-01 backend/domain/contract checkpoint is retained
  at `930b5a2`; its current-boundary resume audit passed without product
  correction, and P5-01 is not `PASS`.
- Current requirement inventory: 282 unique trace rows — 173
  `PACK_CANONICAL`, 95 `DOCX_RECONCILED`, and 14 `ADDENDUM_DIRECT`.
- Current reconciliation authorities:
  `docs/V1_2_RECONCILIATION_ADDENDUM.md`,
  `implementation/V1_2_DOCX_REQUIREMENTS.csv`,
  `implementation/V1_2_DOCX_PACK_COVERAGE_MATRIX.csv`,
  `docs/reference/TOOLING_LIST_FIELD_MAPPING.csv`, and
  `implementation/V1_2_RECONCILIATION_DECISIONS.md`.
- Brand authority: only `docs/Brand Asset/Brand Asset Instruction.csv`, the
  exact five LaunchFlow SVGs and subsequently supplied `Core.png` beside it.
  R1-02 completed the five-SVG LaunchFlow display boundary; `Core.png` remains
  allocated to FR-BR-002/Phase 8/M7-09. No alternative mark, inferred palette,
  redrawn asset or substitute is authorized. Stable technical codes `NPI_ONE`,
  `ERPNEXT` and `/api/npi/v1` remain unchanged.
- First incomplete Phase remains Phase 3
  `TECHNICAL_PASS_PENDING_UAT`; the named business UAT is external and does
  not invalidate its technical evidence or block safe later work.
- Latest completed product Phase remains Phase 4 `PASS`; its historical Gate
  evidence is immutable and is not recalculated against the amended trace.
- Phase 5 remains `IN_PROGRESS`; P5-00 remains a historical `PASS`, P5-01 is
  resumed at its checkpoint, and P5-02 through P5-05 remain inactive.
- R1-01 changed specifications, trace/index metadata, planning and safe
  inspection tooling only. R1-02 changed the shared frontend Shell,
  Frappe-compatible catalogs and display-brand build guard. R1-03 added only
  the fixed authenticated navigation-preference bootstrap/PUT contract and
  shared Shell command/quick-create foundations. R1-04 added the fixed
  authenticated My Work grid-preference resource, shared DenseGrid behavior
  and three additive personal/published-view DocTypes. Its final audit repairs
  keep exact persisted pixel widths, serialize version-confirmed preference
  writes, close the seven-view schema and enforce Unicode code-point search
  limits while keeping publisher, export and bulk authority fail closed.
- R1-05 Stage 1 added one fixed actor-bound My Work inspector preference,
  visible bounded pointer/keyboard resize, collapse/focus recovery and
  responsive presentation-only stacking. Its final evidence records the
  terminal canonical full Gate at 747 Python tests, 577 frontend unit tests
  and 2,671 direct trilingual sources, plus 256 non-visual browser cases, 210
  clean exact visual cases, all 18 controlled route disable/recovery
  contracts, zero residual inspector `DefaultValue` rows and independent
  audits with zero findings.
- R1-05 Stage 2 added reusable field and attachment truth primitives, a
  fail-closed injected transport state machine, visible local-file identity
  through asynchronous/failure states, URL-free exact registered revision
  facts, local-only Trial integration and read-only Gate evidence integration.
  Its Level 2 evidence records 614 frontend unit tests, 2,735 complete direct
  trilingual sources, focused browser `12/12`, affected page `20/20`, Gate
  visual `23/23`, Trial visual `24/24`, zero npm vulnerabilities and an
  independent post-repair PASS.
- R1-05 Stage 3 added a closed local icon-action policy and fail-closed iX
  mapping while preserving visible labels for primary, high-risk and
  ambiguous actions. Its Level 2 evidence records `620/620` frontend unit,
  `754/754` Python, `265/265` non-visual browser and `6/6` affected
  digest-pinned Linux visual cases, complete direct trilingual coverage and
  both action-range and complete-branch secret scans.
- R1-06 Stage 1 passed only as technical no-mutation prototype/governance
  evidence. Its unsigned Product Owner approval keeps the Stage 2 backend
  command and full business claim fail-closed.
- R1-06 Stage 3 and its Level 2 Task Gate passed at the fixed-Linux product
  checkpoint `0b3a7b28bb447edbc165daa95a3e9963f255d832`, followed by the pushed
  evidence/trace/controller checkpoint
  `5fae1784e376c08cd4466c1b38592eb9a7ec513e`. The current exact evidence is
  `762/762` Python, `634/634` frontend unit, `279/279` non-visual browser,
  `24/24` fixed-Linux affected visuals and `2,782` direct trilingual sources.
- `DR-REC-001` remains `PENDING_PRODUCT_OWNER`, so conditional R1-07 is
  skipped without being marked complete. The cumulative R1 shared
  Shell/design/i18n Level 3 exit Gate passed at CI `#72`; recovery checkpoint
  `c980571b27be66e16f2ac57409f0ef72a986e741` then passed CI `#73` with
  `764/764` Python, `634/634` frontend unit, `279/279` non-visual browser and
  `24/24` fixed-Linux visual checks. The exact P5-01 resume-audit checkpoint
  `ee8730133e8cdd30fc7bff158ab80a252ed14249` then passed CI `#74`, run
  `30549749537`, and is the current recovery point. Preserve the scoped holds
  and run only the unfinished P5-01 frontend/runtime slice next.

Resume only from `implementation/NEXT_ACTION.md`, the Phase 5 anchor and the
retained P5-01 checkpoint evidence. Reuse the passing Phase 4, P5-00 and R1
evidence where the current impact map proves the boundary unchanged; do not
repeat or rewrite it merely to restore context. See
`implementation/evidence/reconciliation/r1-shared-bridge-level-3-validation.md`,
`implementation/evidence/phase-5/p5-01-plan.md`,
`implementation/evidence/phase-5/p5-01-resume-audit.md` and
`implementation/LAST_RUN.md` for the exact latest result.
